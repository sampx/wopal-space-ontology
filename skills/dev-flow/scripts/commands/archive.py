#
# Ported from scripts/cmd/archive.sh
#
# Command:
#   archive <issue> - Archive a completed Plan
#
# Flow:
#   1. Find Plan file (by issue number)
#   2. Check Plan status is "done"
#   2.5. Sync Plan to Issue (body + labels)
#   3. Detect worktree and handle cleanup (never commits implementation code)
#   4. Archive Plan file (move to done/)
#   5. Update Issue Plan link
#   6. Commit archived plan in Plan's repo
#   7. Close GitHub Issue
