# Plan Authoring Guide

A Plan has two kinds of readers: **the human reviewer** (must understand what you want) and **the implementing agent** (must be able to build it).

So a Plan's job is to state three things: **what is wanted (behavior)**, **what counts as done (acceptance)**, and **what must not be touched (contracts and boundaries)**. Which files to change and how to organize code internally are decisions that can only be made well during implementation, against the real code — written into a Plan they become straitjackets and guesses.

One line: **pin the contract surface, open up the implementation surface.**

## How to define contracts: Key Interfaces

`Technical Context > Key Interfaces` is the external-contract section. **Entry is a red line.**

**What belongs**: interfaces that cross modules, cross projects, or face outward — CLI commands, API endpoints, events, schemas, exported types. **What does not**: module-private functions and internal helper types. Let those in and the section degenerates into another file-by-file manifest — the rigidity returns.

**How precise**: signature + error codes + key semantics (idempotency, versioning, failure behavior). Write them in the project's own language — TS interface, Python type, JSON Schema all work, as code blocks.

**One criterion**: if a downstream consumer could write their calling code and compatibility tests from this section alone, the contract is defined. If not, it isn't finished.

**Binding force**: an implementing agent that needs to change a signature or error code here must report back and revise the Plan first — silent changes are forbidden. Write N/A when the Plan has no external contract.

**Example**:

```typescript
/** Registers a Plan execution. Repeated calls with the same execution ID
 *  return the same result; no double execution. */
interface BeginExecution {
  request:  { executionId: string; planId: string }
  response: { status: 'started' | 'already-running'; revision: string }
  errors:
    | 'APPROVAL_EXPIRED'   // approval no longer valid, re-review needed
    | 'DEPENDENCY_PENDING' // upstream not delivered
}
```

## How to pin outcomes: the two-beat AC

You cannot write future test commands at Plan time (the test files do not exist yet) — that is reality, not a defect. The two-beat scheme pins outcomes by separating the *right to define* from the *right to prove*:

**Beat 1 (at Plan-writing time)**: each AC = behavioral criterion + pass standard. Write "what observable behavior the system shows, and what you see when it passes". Criterion-style entries are legal — no guessing future file names.

There is exactly one standard for a good beat-1 entry: **can this AC catch a bad implementation?** Ask yourself: if the agent cuts corners or gets it wrong, will this criterion fail? An AC that passes no matter what ("feature works", "build passes") is decoration — beyond submit validation, df-plan-review watches for these too.

**Beat 2 (at implementation RED stage)**: the implementing agent turns each AC into a real command and **writes it back into the Plan in place** (becoming things like `python -m pytest tests/runner/ -v` all green).

**complete hard gate**: the script enforces it — a checked AC must carry a real command; a criterion-style AC cannot pass complete checked. Definition lives in the Plan (the behavior list is reviewable); proof lives in the tests (all green is the only pass). No gap in between.

**Evolution example**:

```markdown
Beat 1 (at Plan-writing time):
1. [ ] Runner consistency tests all green, no interactive hang in the background
2. [ ] Repeated begin with the same execution ID returns the same result, no double execution

Beat 2 (after RED-stage write-back):
1. [x] `python -m pytest tests/runner/consistency/ -v` all green (interactive hang covered by test_no_stdin_hang)
2. [x] `python -m pytest tests/runner/test_idempotent_begin.py -v` all green
```

## How to split Tasks: behavior groups, not files

**One Task = one cohesive Behavior set + a full RED→GREEN→REFACTOR + an independently runnable Verify.**

Three granularity questions:

1. Do these Behaviors share the same test set? (share → same Task)
2. Does it fit in one fae's context for a single delegation? (no → split)
3. Can the Verify run independently? (no → the boundary is drawn wrong, re-split)

Behavior groups are a **requirements-side** concept — clear at Plan time. Files are an **implementation-side** concept — unclear at Plan time. That mismatch was the root of the old format's rigidity; change the splitting dimension and the rigidity disappears.

Tasks no longer carry a Files field. Where to start → Pre-read (points at files that actually exist); step rhythm → Changes; actually touched → backfilled in Done (the single source of truth); coarse-grained scope → the Plan-level Affected Files table. Small tasks with enumerable footprints (bug fixes, single-point adjustments) need no premature file list either — write the real paths in the Affected Files table.

## How to write TDD

### Behavior is a spec, not a description

Behavior (required when TDD=true) is a testable behavior spec; format is free: input→output mappings, Given/When/Then, all fine. The criterion: **the implementing agent can turn each Behavior into a failing test without guessing.** A Behavior you cannot write a test for is not yet specified — fix the Behavior, not the standard.

```markdown
**Behavior**:
- valid_email("user@example.com") → true
- valid_email("") → false
- valid_email("no-at-sign") → false
```

### Changes entry 1 is always RED

The numbered-list format is unchanged (no checkboxes), but entry 1 now has a fixed meaning — turn all Behaviors into failing tests:

```markdown
**Changes**:
1. RED: turn the Behaviors above into failing tests and confirm they fail
2. GREEN: implement the email validator until all tests pass
3. REFACTOR: extract the regex constant (if needed)
```

### Full TDD Task example

```markdown
**Verification Intent**: AC#1, AC#2

**Behavior**:
- valid_email("user@example.com") → true
- valid_email("") → false
- valid_email("no-at-sign") → false

**Pre-read**: `src/validators/pattern.py`

**Design**:
Add an email validator, reusing the regex style of pattern.py.
Errors return false instead of throwing (callers render; exception flow does not fit).

**TDD**: true

**Changes**:
1. RED: turn the Behaviors above into failing tests and confirm they fail
2. GREEN: implement valid_email() until all tests pass
3. REFACTOR: extract the EMAIL_REGEX constant (if needed)

**Verify**: `python -m pytest tests/ -v` all passing

**Done**:
Task output: email validation function + 3 test cases
Actually touched files: (backfilled after implementation)
- [ ] The implementing agent has completed all steps of development and verification.
```

### When to use TDD

**Core heuristic**: can you describe the behavior as `expect(fn(input)).toBe(output)` before writing `fn`? Yes → TDD; no → standard Task, add tests afterwards as needed.

- **Fits**: business logic with clear input/output, API endpoints, data transforms, validation rules, algorithms, state machines
- **Does not fit**: UI layout/styling, config changes, glue code, exploratory prototypes, simple CRUD with no business logic

### TDD stage discipline

| Stage | Problem | Handling |
|------|------|------|
| RED | Test did not fail | Feature may already exist or the test is wrong — investigate before continuing |
| GREEN | Test did not pass | Debug the implementation, iterate until green; do not jump to refactoring |
| REFACTOR | Test failed | Undo the refactor, retry with smaller steps |

**A RED that does not fail is the most common trap**: it means the test does not actually cover the intended behavior — fix it before continuing.

### TDD commit advice

Commit per stage (one commit per stage, code on the feature branch):

```
test(scope): add failing test for email validation
feat(scope): implement email validation
refactor(scope): extract regex to constant
```

Tick the corresponding Done checkbox in the Plan after each Task (the Plan file lives in the space repo and commits separately).

## Task field quick reference

| Field | Required | Notes |
|------|------|------|
| **Verification Intent** | yes | AC#N; which acceptance entries this behavior group answers for |
| **Behavior** | yes when TDD=true | Testable spec, directly translatable into a failing test |
| **Pre-read** | yes | Files to read before implementing; N/A if unneeded |
| **Design** | yes | Approach, key ideas, constraints — intent stated clearly, not file-by-file dictates |
| **TDD** | yes | true/false; false needs a reason |
| **Changes** | yes | Numbered list; entry 1 is always RED |
| **Verify** | yes | Executable command; exit 0 required before ticking Done |
| **Done** | yes | Output summary + actually-touched files + checkbox |

## The Agent Verification / User Validation boundary

### Agent Verification (everything automatable)

Everything verifiable automatically goes here: tests, lint, typecheck, static checks, scriptable behavior assertions. Two-beat scheme above. Cross-Task verifications go at the end of the list, marked "(cross-Task)".

Purely descriptive entries are forbidden: ❌ "build passes" / "feature works" / "no errors" — criteria must be able to catch a bad implementation.

### User Validation (only what the user can verify)

Carries only items **the user must execute and observe by hand**: UI/UX, interaction feel, business flows, visual confirmation.

**Mandatory double question before writing into UV**:

1. Can an agent verify this automatically? → Yes: **UV forbidden**; put it in Agent Verification
2. Must the user execute and observe it manually? → No: **UV forbidden**

**Four mandatory elements per scenario**:

| Element | Requirement | Bad example (fails) |
|---|---|---|
| Validation environment | Reference the mechanism section in project specs or the script entry | Just "start the app" |
| Launch command | One real command the user can copy-paste, env vars included | "Run the command and observe" |
| Pass criteria | A specific, assertable observable result | "Confirm behavior is correct" |
| Failure feedback | What the user provides on failure (log path, diff output) | Missing |

If a mechanism the validation depends on is not yet documented in the project's AGENTS.md, add it to the project spec first, then reference it — never let it appear once in a Plan and be lost.

**Correct scenario example**:

```markdown
#### Scenario 1: onboarding flow regression-free
- Goal: Confirm each wizard step behaves as before the change
- 验证环境: AGENTS.md "validation mechanisms" section (ELLAMAKA_TEST_ONBOARDING sandbox mode)
- Precondition: sandbox mode (WOPAL_HOME=/tmp/wopal-onboarding-sandbox), no build needed
- Launch command: `ELLAMAKA_TEST_ONBOARDING=1 ./scripts/dev.sh desktop`
- User Actions:
  1. Walk the onboarding flow: system check → install CLI → configure AI provider
  2. Watch prompts and status at each step
- Pass criteria: steps advance normally, no new errors, no `[object Object]` text in the UI
- Failure feedback: attach `logs/dev/<scope>/ellamaka-dev-desktop.log` and `git diff -w` output

- [ ] The user has completed the validation above and confirmed the results
```

## Metadata rules

`Project Path`, `Project Type`, `Target Project` are looked up from the space's `STRUCTURE.md`:

1. Determine the domain from the code paths involved (ontology / projects / contents / ...)
2. Match path/type/repo in `STRUCTURE.md` frontmatter or tables
3. Fill in the mapping:

| STRUCTURE.md type | Project Type | Project Path example |
|---|---|---|
| `ontology-worktree` | ontology-worktree | `.wopal/` |
| `projects` | projects | `projects/<name>/` |
| `contents` | contents | `contents/<name>/` |

Common mistakes: treating a subdirectory (e.g. `.wopal/plugins/wopal-plugin/`) as the project root — use the worktree root `.wopal/`; classifying an ontology worktree as a normal project — it is a worktree of an independent repo.

## Plans, phases, and Gaps

Plans add no Gap-related metadata fields. The phase–Gap relationship is carried naturally by product phase documents; a Plan only states its phase in Goal or Context.

- **Plan phase**: the `Phase` metadata field (inherited from the Issue body). A phase splits into multiple Plans by scope area; the phase's `Related Plans` table is the aggregate view.
- **Phase table registration**: only Plans linked to a phase (metadata carrying `Product` + `Phase`) trigger phase-doc sync at archive — `archive` locates the row by the ` · <plan-name>` suffix of the slot label and writes `done`. Format spec in dev-doc-master skill `references/phase.md`.
- **Unlinked Plans** get no phase-doc handling at archive (skipped silently, no warnings, no errors). Ordinary feature/fix/refactor Plans neither need nor should write `Product`/`Phase`, and never invent rows in phase tables.
- **Gaps**: the single source of truth is the project's `GAPS.md`. Plans reference the Gap identifier they close (e.g. `CLI-G3`) in Goal or Context without copying the description. When a Plan reaches `done` and its Exit criteria hold, the entry is removed from `GAPS.md` (the number retires, never reused).

## Delegation prompt format

**Plan-driven task** (recommended):

    ## Plan
    Read the Plan file and execute Task <N>:
    <absolute path to the Plan document>

    ## Context
    - Working path: project directory absolute path (worktree absolute path)
    - Implementation baseline: Base Commit from Plan Metadata (integration branch HEAD, recorded at approve)
    - Implementation freedom: Behaviors, Key Interfaces contracts, and boundaries are hard constraints; file organization, internal APIs, and test structure are yours to decide on the latest code
    - AC write-back: at the RED stage, turn each AC into a real command and update the Plan's Agent Verification in place
    - Commit git after each task's implementation and verification
    - Follow project and module development specs (AGENTS.md)
    - <Only extra emphases beyond the Plan; omit if none>

    ## Completion criteria
    - <key verification points, briefly>

    ## Task Report
    On completion output: Goal/Accomplished/Files/Status

**Ad-hoc task without a Plan**:

    ## Goal
    <one line>

    ## Context
    - Project path: /path/to/file

    ## Steps
    1. Read the relevant files
    2. Modify files
    3. Run verification

    ## Completion criteria
    - Feature verification passes

    ## Task Report
    On completion output: Goal/Accomplished/Files/Status

**Principle**: with a Plan, the Plan is the single source of information; the prompt never duplicates Plan content.

### Mandatory delegation prompt addition

Every fae delegation for a Plan Task must append this at the end:

    After completion, edit the corresponding Task's Done checkbox (- [ ] → - [x]) in the Plan file, and backfill the "actually touched files" list inside Done. Plan file path: <space-repo absolute path>
    Never modify Plan Status metadata (Status/Worktree/Base Commit etc. are managed by flow.sh)

Omitting this = fae never updates the Plan, and every Done is missed.

## Top 5 common errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|------|-----|
| `missing Design` | Skipped the Design field | Add `**Design**:` + implementation design |
| `TDD=true requires Behavior` | TDD flag set but no Behavior | Add the testable behavior spec |
| `Changes must not use checkbox` | Changes used `- [ ] Step N:` | Numbered list `1. 2. 3.`, entry 1 always RED |
| `AC checked but carries no executable command` | Criterion-style AC checked straight through complete | Write the real command back into the AC entry at the RED stage before checking |
| `placeholder: 'TBD'` | Leftover placeholder | Replace with real content or delete the line |

## Validation and advancement

- `submit` / `approve` run `plan check` automatically; no manual run needed
- `approve` is not a first check — it is the node that enters "awaiting user review"
- If `approve` is blocked by validation → fix the Plan and re-run `approve`

## Plan naming rules

The Plan name is the authoritative identifier used to derive feature branches. Names must be lean — Issue titles are free text; Plan names and branch names must be short.

### Naming structure

```
<issue_number>-<type>-<slug>     # Issue-driven
<type>-<slug>                    # no Issue
```

- `type` uses standard values (feature/fix/enhance/refactor/docs/test/chore/perf), fully spelled
- No `scope` segment — scope already shows up in `--project` and the slug

### Slug rules

- slug = **1-2 core nouns**, kebab-case, **≤ 20 chars**
- Drop verb phrases and articles; keep the noun core
- Truncate or rewrite when too long; never copy the issue title

| Verbose (forbidden) | Lean (target) |
|--------------|--------------|
| `implement-multi-space-chat-projector-sync` | `chat-projector-sync` |
| `add-skills-remove-command` | `skills-remove` |
| `support-handling-expired-tokens` | `token-expiry` |

### Plan directory rules

- New Plans must be created or located via `flow.sh plan ...`; never hand-write files
- `--project` is a required parameter
- All projects live under `.wopal-space/plans/<project>/`

## Branch naming rules

Feature branches derive from the Plan name and must be bounded — no unbounded concatenation:

```
<project>-<issue>-<type>-<slug-truncated>
```

Past 55 chars total, truncate the slug and append a 4-char hash:

```
<project>-<issue>-<type>-<slug-head>-<hash4>
```

Worktree directory = branch. The branch name carries "unique and mappable back to the Plan" — it is not a full-text copy of the Plan name.

## Branch ownership

| Stage | Branch | Plan status | Notes |
|------|---------|----------|------|
| `planning` | integration branch (main or space/<name>) | `planning` | Plan baseline committed on the integration branch |
| `approve --confirm` | integration branch → create feature branch | `executing` | Commit executing + Worktree metadata on the integration branch first, then create the worktree |
| Implementation (executing) | feature branch | `executing` | Implementation happens in the feature branch's worktree |
| `complete` | feature branch | `verifying` | Plan-only commit of the active Plan (dirty implementation tree aborts) |
| User validation | feature branch | `verifying` | The user validates on the feature branch |
| `verify --confirm` | integration branch | `done` | Plan-only commit to the integration branch |
| `archive` | integration branch | archived | Moved to done/, worktree cleaned up |

**Plan-only commit principle**: lifecycle scripts commit only Plan status changes, never implementation code. Code commits belong to the implementing agent (fae). Scripts abort on a dirty implementation tree rather than committing code on its behalf.
