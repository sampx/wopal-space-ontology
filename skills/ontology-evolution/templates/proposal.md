# {name}

<!--
Proposal naming contract — inherited by every new proposal from this shared
skeleton.

- Structure: `<type>-<slug>`; `type` uses the standard values, fully spelled
  (feature / fix / enhance / refactor / docs / test / chore / perf).
- `slug` = 1–2 core nouns, kebab-case, ≤ 20 chars. Drop verb phrases and
  articles; never copy the title.
- The name is load-bearing: `accept` derives the isolation branch and the
  worktree directory by prefixing `ontology-` to the **entire proposal name**
  (the stem): `refactor-ontology-maintenance` yields
  `ontology-refactor-ontology-maintenance`, and a verbose name produces an
  unreadable branch.

| Verbose (forbidden) | Lean (target) |
|---------------------|---------------|
| `consolidate-ontology-maintenance-into-the-ontology-evolution-skill` | `refactor-ontology-maintenance` |
-->

## Metadata

<!--
Mode / Worktree / Branch / Base Commit are recorded by `accept`, Final Commit
by `integrate`; `Stage` advances only through `wopal space evo advance`.
Never hand-edit any of these — the fields stay `(none)` until the mechanism
writes them.
-->

- **Type**: {type}
- **Project Path**: .wopal
- **Created**: {created}
- **Stage**: draft
- **Mode**: (none)
- **Worktree**: (none)
- **Branch**: (none)
- **Base Commit**: (none)
- **Final Commit**: (none)

## Scope Assessment

<!--
Pick one level per dimension; do not overrate. Complexity drives the
delegation waves; Confidence tells the reader how strong the evidence is.
-->
- **Complexity**: <Low | Medium | High>
- **Confidence**: <High | Medium | Low>

## Goal

<!--
One sentence: what this evolution is meant to achieve. Readers decide from
here whether to keep reading.
-->
<What this evolution aims to achieve.>

## Technical Context

<!-- Four subsections; keep the ones that apply, at least one. -->

### Architecture Context

<!--
Current state + why it must change. Cite the design source of truth
(DESIGN-*.md) and key code locations (file:line) — evidence first.
-->
<Current mechanism, modules involved, and why it must change.>

### Research Findings

<!-- Research conclusions; the reference list holds context document paths only. -->
<Research conclusion summary>

**References**:
- `<context document path>`

### Key Decisions

<!-- Settled decisions numbered D-01, D-02, ...; decision + rationale, no implementation detail. -->
- D-01: <decision and rationale>

### Key Interfaces

<!--
External contracts (hard constraint): command behavior, file naming, error
codes, boundary conditions. Once listed, it is a red line — changing it
during implementation requires reporting back for a revised proposal.
Write N/A when there is no external contract.
-->
<Contract definition, or N/A>

## In Scope

<!-- What this round delivers, item by item, checkable. -->
- <Item 1>
- <Item 2>

## Out of Scope

<!--
What is deliberately excluded and why. Keep "deliberately cut" separate from
"awaiting the user's call" so the reader does not mistake it for an omission.
-->
- <Excluded item and reason>

## Affected Files

<!-- Expected footprint, not a construction list; implementation may adjust. -->
| Component | Files | Operation | Role |
|-----------|-------|-----------|------|
| <component> | `file1`, `file2` | create / modify / delete | <role in this change> |

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent Verification

<!--
Two-beat rule: write behavioral criteria now (decidable, able to catch a bad
implementation); during implementation each one gets a real command and is
written back here. Every entry maps to a Task's Verification Intent.
-->
1. [ ] <Behavioral criterion + pass standard>

### User Validation

<!--
Only items an agent cannot verify and the user must observe by hand. Every
scenario needs: environment, launch command, user actions, pass criteria,
failure feedback.
-->
#### Scenario 1: <user-observable behavior>
- Goal: <validation goal>
- Environment: <environment reference>
- Precondition: <precondition>
- Launch command: <copy-pasteable command>
- User Actions:
  1. <step>
- Pass criteria: <assertable expected result>
- Failure feedback: <what the user provides on failure>

- [ ] The user has validated the behavior above and confirmed the result.

## Implementation

<!--
Tasks split by behavior group, not by file. One Task = one cohesive
behavior unit, independently testable.
-->

### Task 1: <task title>

**Verification Intent**: <Agent Verification entry number(s) this task answers>

**Behavior**:
- <given input / condition → observable result>

**Pre-read**: <files to read before implementing>

**Design**: <approach, key ideas, constraints>

**TDD**: true

**Changes**:
1. RED: turn the Behavior above into a failing test
2. GREEN: implement until the test passes

**Verify**: <verification command>

**Done**:
Task output: <one line>
Files touched: <fill in after implementation>
- [ ] The implementation agent has completed all development and verification steps above.

## Delegation Strategy

<!-- Required for 2+ Tasks or Complexity = High; Wave batches the parallel work. -->

| Wave | Task | Executor | Depends on | Why delegated |
|------|------|----------|------------|---------------|
| 1 | Task 1 | fae | none | <reason> |

## Delivery

`space sync` and `ontology contribute` are the user's call — the skill never uploads on its own.
