name: space-master
description: |
  Root skill and master specification for WopalSpace. Everything a space can do — how it runs, how it is configured, how to write commands/rules/skills/templates — is defined in the ontology repository and distributed to spaces through the central capability pool, with space evolution flowing back through space sync.

  MUST load when:
  - Space structure maintenance: space init/status, .wopal directory layout, assembly model, how the space runs and is configured
  - Space capability authoring: writing and modifying commands, rules, skills, templates
  - AGENTS.md authoring: creating or updating project/directory AGENTS.md
  - README authoring: creating or updating project-level README.md
  - Skill lifecycle: install, scan, remove
  - Task intent is ambiguous or Wopal is unsure which workflow/skill to use — this is the routing entry point

  Ontology maintenance and evolution are executed by the `ontology-evolution` skill, not this one: for ontology repo operations (update, sync, capability discovery, contribution, PR), load `ontology-evolution` directly — this skill only routes; loading both is not required.

  [CRITICAL] Load `ontology-evolution` whenever ontology repo operations (update/sync/PR) appear, even if the user does not explicitly say "upstream sync".

# space-master

Routes Wopal's decisions for workflow selection, scene-to-skill mapping, ontology maintenance, AGENTS.md maintenance, and the skill lifecycle.

## Skill Usage Scenarios

Space skills each serve their own purpose. Choose by scenario; do not stack loads:

| Scenario | Load | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Dev / Fix / Refactor (Issue/Plan driven) | `dev-flow` | Default development workflow; tasks run through its state machine (planning → reviewing → executing → verifying → done) |
| Ontology maintenance (instance updates, space alignment, capability assembly, contribution) | `ontology-evolution` | Load it directly for any ontology repo operation; this skill only routes |
| Ontology capability evolution (skills, rules, agents, commands, plugins, assembly under `.wopal/`) | `ontology-evolution` | Object test: ontology capability assets → this skill; code repositories under `projects/` → `dev-flow` |
| Delegate any sub-agent (fae, rook, wsf-*, etc.) | `agents-collab` | MUST load before delegation; covers delegation tool APIs, task lifecycle, two-way communication, progress monitoring, and recovery |
| Create / modify / evaluate a skill | `skill-creator` | MUST load for new, edited, or evaluated skills; includes description optimization and evaluation flow |

This skill directly owns WopalSpace's space governance work — no routing needed:

- **AGENTS.md maintenance**: creating or updating project-level or directory-level AGENTS.md — rule audit, content boundaries, workflow
- **README maintenance**: creating or updating project-level README.md — human-facing project entry documentation, capability-aware conditional document-set alignment
- **Skill maintenance**: the skill lifecycle — install, scan, remove

## Ontology Maintenance

Ontology maintenance and capability evolution are executed by the **`ontology-evolution` skill** — load it directly for any ontology repo operation: instance updates, space alignment, capability assembly, and upstream contribution all follow its Maintenance Protocols. Loading this skill as well is not required.

It is the single specification point — command surface, status reading, channels and the upload gate, execution stance, and contribution scope. This skill carries no maintenance protocol of its own.

## AGENTS.md Maintenance

When creating or updating a project-level or directory-level `AGENTS.md`, work by these rules:

1. **Audit existing rules first**: before updating an existing `AGENTS.md`, audit every current rule (per the Rule Audit criteria in the reference):
   - **Delete**: code no longer exists / structure guarantees it (single source of truth) / duplicates an authoritative document / pure implementation fact
   - **Keep**: safety boundaries (deletion scope, single credential write path), behavior constraints, User-Supplied Rules
   - **Fix**: directory descriptions outdated, conflicts with a newer design mechanism, language versions drifted
2. **Plan before writing**: present the audit classification (keep / delete / fix with reasons) plus the proposed change list, and wait for user confirmation
3. **Review version first, formal version second**: update `AGENTS.<locale>.md` first, then the formal English `AGENTS.md` after approval
4. Not updating is the default and legitimate outcome — update only when code, tests, config, and existing docs cannot carry the boundary

**Full specification** (content boundaries, workflow, quality checklist) lives in `references/agents-md-maintenance.md`. The `/cupdate-agent-rules` command is an entry point only and carries no specification.

## README Maintenance

When creating or updating a project-level `README.md`, work by these rules:

1. **Capability awareness first**: read `.wopal-space/space-meta.json` for the space `type` and the installed skills (`capabilities.skills`); when the metadata is missing, probe the filesystem (does `docs/`, `DESIGN.md`, or `AGENTS.md` exist?). Document-set alignment runs only when the space assembles the relevant documentation-set skills — when it does not, skip alignment and never assume.
2. **Plan before writing**: present the full optimization plan (target file path, one-sentence project description, module / core command overview, sections to add/modify/remove, canonical documents to reference) and wait for explicit user confirmation
3. **Review version first, formal version second**: when the user's preferred language is not English, create `README.<locale>.md` for review first; update the formal English `README.md` after confirmation
4. **Verify commands**: install / run / development commands are always verified from package and config files — never guess

**Full specification** (capability awareness, template, quality checklist) lives in `references/readme-maintenance.md`. The `/cupdate-readme` command is an entry point only and carries no specification.

## Skill Maintenance

### Lifecycle

```
find → download → scan → install → evaluate → remove
```

```bash
wopal skills find "<query>"              # Search registries
wopal skills download owner/repo@name    # Download to review inbox
wopal skills scan <name>                 # Security scan (MANDATORY)
wopal skills install /path --force       # Install to runtime
wopal skills remove <name> --force       # Remove from space
```

### Skill Rules

1. **Scan before install.** `wopal skills scan` is mandatory — it checks for malicious code, data exfiltration, and invalid triggers. Never skip it.
2. **Verify after change.** After install or edit: `ls -la .wopal/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and `wopal skills list`.
3. **Create or modify via `skill-creator`.** Load the `skill-creator` skill for any new skill or edit.

## References

The skill body covers the essentials. When troubleshooting or encountering edge cases, **read the reference documents** — they contain the full protocol:

| Document | What you'll find |
|----------|------------------|
| `references/skills-maintenance.md` | Full lifecycle details, security scan checks, quality evaluation criteria |
| `references/agents-md-maintenance.md` | Full AGENTS.md maintenance specification: content boundaries, rule audit criteria, workflow, quality checklist |
| `references/readme-maintenance.md` | Full README maintenance specification: capability awareness, language version rules, template, quality checklist |
